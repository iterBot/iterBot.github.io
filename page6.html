            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>This week the group focused on brain storming the finishing features that will be required in the final project. There are 3 main features that need to be completed. The first is the ability for the user to alter the target position of the creatures. This feature would enable a more concrete example of how the program can alter the features of the individuals to accommodate changing fitness requirements. A subset of this feature is the need to have a UI component that handles all runtime controls, alongside the nonruntime controls. Another feature that needs to be completed is the rendering of joints. For the purposes of performance, only the best individual of the previous generation will have the joints rendered, this is the most time intensive task on the table, but this feature would make the simulation much easier to understand for the user. The final feature that needs to be completed before moving on to the final stages of the project, is the finalization of the terrain. We are currently testing the various types of terrain that create the most impressive solutions. Some maps are less interesting for the algorithm and do not present the concepts of genetics as well as other ones. More testing is needed to develop the exact types of terrain that will be used in the final product. These are the 3 goals that need to be completed before we can move on to the detailed description of the processes taking place in our program. We will be utilizing pictures for the purposes of the educational elements of the program, so we need to finalize artistic decisions before moving on to these portions of the program.</strong><div><strong><br></strong></div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Week eight has been a solid week for our team. Many changes were made but the most noteable changes were focused on polishing up the UI to increase readability for users. New additions allow the user to change camera angles to the new action camera and get an upclose view with each simulation. The real time statistics panel was finished to show which generation the simulation is on, the current winning fitness, and how much time has progressed even during an increased time scale. A new tooltip was added to show the user what each setting does as their mouse pointer hovers over a setting during the simulation. Ontop of all the UI stuff the team also changed the way maps are created and added to the software. A map can be created by a iterBot member following certain dimension constraints and the software will handle the rest by adding the start/finish points which measure fitness as well as duplicate the terrain for however many bots are being tested within a generation. As far as core components we are very happy with how the software performs and wish to begin wrapping up the project soon. The next few weeks will be mostly dedicated to adding the educational side of the project to the Menu as well as looking for feedback from users outside of the team. The team will also shift most of the focus into documentation to make sure everything is ready for presentation time.</strong></div>

The main discussion of the week was redefining our description of fitness. Previously fitness was determined by analyzing how far a bot travels in a certain period of time. During our testing we began to notice that our program would highly favor small simple bots that traveled really fast but carried no weight. After some thought and consideration the group decided it would be best to incorporate weight into the equation. The new formula takes into account not only the bots ability to move a distance but also how much weight it is carrying along with it. This change allows larger complex bots to form and become winners which has already became noticable in our testing. Perhaps the biggest breakthrough this week was successfully implementing the first stages of bot mutation. In the current build, new generations are created by taking their ancestors and mutating them slightly. Check out the linked photos for an example.</strong><br></p></div>

This week, the main focus of the project was getting the bots to a point where they'd be ready to mutate. The bots created last week, were forming with some excess parts that were not attached to the body of the bot. These unnecessary parts no longer spawn sporadically. This was corrected by removing the DNA strand associated with singular blocks. This allowed us to move forward with distinguishing the different weights of each body segment. The weights go from light to dark in color as the weight increases. The lightest segments appear white, while the heaviest segments appear black. As this week comes to an end, the goal is to also create joints that are color coded in a way similar to the body segments. From there, this week's goal of being able to mutate the bots will have been reached. Moving into next week, the goal is to successfully mutate individual bots. Moving forward, we would like to have a fitness scoring method setup before moving onto topics such as the terrain or UI.</strong><br></p></div>
